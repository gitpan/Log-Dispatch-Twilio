NAME
    Log::Dispatch::Twilio - Log output via Twilio SMS Message

SYNOPSIS
      use Log::Dispatch;

      my $logger = Log::Dispatch->new(
          outputs => [
              [ 'Twilio,
                min_level   => 'emergency',
                account_sid => '<your-twilio-account-sid>',
                auth_token  => '<your-twilio-auth-token>',
                from        => '<number-to-send-msg-from>',
                to          => '<number-to-send-msg-to>',
              ],
          ],
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a "Log::Dispatch" output that sends log messages
    via Twilio.

    While you probably don't want *every* logged message from your
    application to go out via Twilio, I find it particularly useful to set
    it up as part of my "Log::Dispatch" configuration for critical/emergency
    errors. In the event that something dire happens, I'll receive an SMS
    message through Twilio right away.

  Required Options
    When adding Twilio output to your Log::Dispatch configuration, the
    following options are required:

    account_sid
        Your Twilio "Account Sid".

    auth_token
        Your Twilio "Auth Token".

    from
        The telephone number from which the SMS messages will appear to be
        sent from.

        This number must be a number attached to your Twilio account.

    to  The telephone number to which the SMS messages will be sent to.

METHODS
    new Constructor.

        Implemented as per the Log::Dispatch::Output interface.

    log_message
        Logs message, by sending it as an SMS message to the configured
        number via the Twilio API.

        Implemented as per the Log::Dispatch::Output interface.
